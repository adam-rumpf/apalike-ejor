\section{Introduction}

This example document demonstrates the usage of the \texttt{apalike-ejor} style, which was developed for formatting bibliographies in accordance with the \textit{European Journal of Operational Research} \href{https://www.elsevier.com/journals/european-journal-of-operational-research/0377-2217/guide-for-authors}{style guide} (as it appeared on June 18, 2021).

The Bib\TeX\ style file \texttt{apalike-ejor.bst} is a fork of \texttt{apalike.bst}, originally by Oren Patashnik, and mostly follows the standard APA style. Among other edits hyperlinked URL and DOI fields have been added, which requires the usage of the \texttt{hyperref} package.

In order to use \texttt{apalike-ejor}, make sure that the \texttt{apalike.ejor.bst} file is located somewhere where your compiler can find it, then compile your document with Bib\TeX\ a couple of times followed by \LaTeX\ a couple of times. At minimum the following should be included in your main \texttt{.tex} document:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib} % required for inline citations
\usepackage{hyperref} % required if utilizing url or doi fields

\begin{document}
%%%
%%% include the main body of the document here
%%%

\bibliographystyle{apalike-ejor}
\bibliography{example-references} % replace with your .bib file

%%%
%%% include any text following the bibliography here
%%%
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

Thank you to Oren Patashnik for writing the original \texttt{apalike} style file on which this was based. This modification of \texttt{apalike}, and the other files in this package, were largely based on the \texttt{zootaxa-bst} package by Gustavo A.\ Ballen, and seeing the \texttt{zootaxa-bst} repository on \href{https://github.com/gaballench/zootaxa-bst}{GitHub} is what originally gave me the motivation to make this slapdash and kludgy personal tool available to the public. Thank you also to the \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/}{\LaTeX\ Stack Exchange} community, whose guidance proved invaluable in figuring out the basics of the \texttt{.bst} format, as well as to the \href{https://www.ctan.org/}{CTAN} community for making so much \TeX\ material openly available. Finally thank you to my graduate advisor Hemanshu Kaul, without whom I would never have been in a position to submit a paper to \textit{EJOR} in the first place.
