\section{Introduction}

This example document demonstrates the usage of the \texttt{apalike-ejor} style, which was developed for formatting bibliographies in accordance with the \textit{European Journal of Operational Research} \href{https://www.elsevier.com/journals/european-journal-of-operational-research/0377-2217/guide-for-authors}{style guide} (as of June 18, 2021).

The Bib\TeX\ style file \texttt{apalike-ejor.bst} is a fork of \texttt{apalike}, originally by Oren Patashnik, and mostly follows the standard APA style. Among other edits hyperlinked URL and DOI fields have been added, which requires the usage of the \texttt{hyperref} package.

In order to use \texttt{apalike-ejor}, make sure that the \texttt{apalike.ejor.bst} file is located somewhere where your compiler can find it, then compile your document with Bib\TeX\ a couple of times followed by \LaTeX\ a couple of times. At minimum the following should be included in your main \texttt{.tex} document:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib} % required for inline citations
\usepackage{hyperref} % required if utilizing url or doi fields

\begin{document}
%%%
%%% include the main body of the document here
%%%

\bibliographystyle{apalike-ejor}
\bibliography{example-references} % replace with your .bib file

%%%
%%% include any text following the bibliography here
%%%
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
