# `apalike-ejor`

BibTeX `apalike-ejor` bibliography style, adapted from the [`apalike`](https://www.bibtex.com/s/bibliography-style-base-apalike/) style, version 0.99a, by Oren Patashnik. The original copyright and documentation are included in the file. This file is released under the same terms as the original `apalike.bst` file.

This is a lightly modified APA-like bibliography style made in accordance with the European Journal of Operational Research [reference style guidelines](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/european-journal-of-operational-research/0377-2217/guide-for-authors).

Specific deviations from the original `apalike` settings include the following:
 * Changed "and" to "&" in lists of multiple authors.
 * Changed ":" to ", " between volume number and page numbers.
 * Added a hyperlinked URL field (requires `hyperref`).
 * Added a hyperlinked DOI field (requires `hyperref`).
 * Removed address information from publisher names.
 * Removed editor information, publisher information, and the words "In" and "pages" from conference proceedings.
 * Removed thesis label from theses.
